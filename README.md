# One-Time-Pad
### What is a One-Time Pad?
A [One-Time Pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) is a method of encryption that is mathmatically impossible to break if done correctly. 
The most important part is that the key used for encryption is truly random. Instead of using a psudo form of random generation, the program takes user input such as mouse movement
and combines it with clock timing in order to get true random.

### Flow
The entire program runs on the console. There is a very simple setup process that asks the user a few basic wuestions in order to get the enviroment set up properly.
Once the enviroment is set up, the user has the option to Generate, Encrypt, or Decrypt.

### Side Notes
I'm terrible at documentation, but I'm trying to get better, so bare with me.
